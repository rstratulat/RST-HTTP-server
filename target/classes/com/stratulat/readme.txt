A. A multi-threaded (e.g. file-based) web server with thread-pooling implemented in Java.
Extension: Add proper HTTP/1.1 keep-alive behavior to your implementation based on the http-client's capabilities exposed through its request headers.
 
General rules
The extension is optional unless requested (see below).
Please note that Adobe has considerable experience with publicly available examples as we have been using this assessment for many years. We realize that many implementations exist on the Internet and are very familiar with them.
We will not hold copying existing source code against you since in real-life leveraging existing code may, at times, be the best and quickest way to get a good result. Be aware though that not all publicly available solutions are of good code quality and we will consider your choice as part of the assessment.
We will also not hold it against you if you choose to write the entire example from scratch.
If you do decide to copy code from third party resources, please consider the following when submitting your code:
• Declare which parts of the sample is your own code
• Reference all copied code and where you took it from: do not remove copyrights or comments. Any violation of copyrights or obfuscation tactics will reflect negatively on your assessment.
• If after reviewing your example we do not feel we have enough of your own code to evaluate, we may ask you to add the extension.



A web server is an information technology that processes requests via HTTP, 
the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web. 
The term can refer either to the entire computer system, an appliance, or specifically to the software 
that accepts and supervises the HTTP requests.
